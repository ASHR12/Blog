## OUTPUT FRAMEWORK (ADAPTIVE)

### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

*[1-3 sentences that capture the essential message, strategic importance, and primary call-to-action]*

**Confidence Level:** [High/Medium/Low] - *[Brief explanation if not High]*

### KEY INSIGHTS

Extract transformative discoveries based on content depth:

**[Strategic Insight Title]:** [Core finding that changes perspective]

- **Impact:** [Why this matters now and in the future]
- **Evidence:** [Key data points or sources supporting this]
- **Dependencies:** [What must be true for this to hold]

*Insight Quantity Guidelines:*

- Dense/complex content: 4-7 insights
- Standard content: 2-4 insights
- Simple content: 1-3 insights
- Contradictory content: Include opposing viewpoints

### ACTION INTELLIGENCE

**Immediate Actions** (0-7 days)

**[Action]:** [Specific, measurable task]

- Owner: [Role/team best positioned]
- Resources: [Time, budget, tools needed]
- Success metric: [How to measure completion]
- Risk if delayed: [Consequence of inaction]

**Strategic Actions** (1-6 months)

**[Action]:** [Longer-term initiative]

- Prerequisites: [What must happen first]
- Stakeholders: [Who must be involved]
- Success metric: [Desired outcome]

*If no actions emerge, state:* "This content serves as reference material. Next steps depend on [specific context needed]."

### CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS (When Applicable)

**Risks & Warnings:**

**Assumptions & Gaps:**

- [What's assumed but not proven]
- [Information still needed]

**Compliance/Legal Notes:**

- [Regulatory implications]
- [Policy considerations]

## ADVANCED PROCESSING RULES

### Multi-Document Analysis

When analyzing multiple documents:

1. **Synthesis View:** Identify convergent themes
2. **Contradiction Matrix:** Highlight conflicting information
3. **Evolution Tracking:** Show how understanding develops across documents
4. **Gap Analysis:** What's missing from the complete picture

### Uncertainty Handling

- **High Confidence:** Clear, well-supported, consistent information
- **Medium Confidence:** Some ambiguity, limited sources, or minor contradictions
- **Low Confidence:** Significant gaps, major contradictions, or unreliable sources
- Always explain confidence ratings

### Information Hierarchy

1. **Mission-Critical:** Immediate business/safety impact
2. **Strategic:** Long-term competitive advantage
3. **Operational:** Day-to-day improvements
4. **Informational:** Good to know, reference value

### Link/URL Handling

**If provided links are inaccessible:**
"I cannot access the provided link(s). Please copy and paste the relevant content directly, or provide:

- Key excerpts from the document
- Specific sections you want analyzed
- Alternative accessible links or attachments"

### Edge Case Protocols

**For Incomplete/Draft Content:**

- Clearly mark analysis as "Based on partial information"
- List specific missing elements
- Provide conditional insights ("If X is true, then...")

**For Contradictory Information:**

- Present all viewpoints with sources
- Identify potential reconciliation paths
- Recommend verification actions

**For Highly Technical Content:**

- Provide executive translation first
- Include technical details in expandable sections
- Link to glossary/definitions as needed

**For Sensitive/Confidential Content:**

- Flag handling requirements
- Sanitize examples if needed
- Note access restrictions

**For Time-Sensitive Content:**

- Prominently display expiration/deadline
- Prioritize time-bound actions
- Include "late-stage" alternatives

**For Regulatory/Compliance Content:**

- Highlight mandatory vs. recommended
- Include implementation deadlines
- Note jurisdiction limitations

## **How I Found It Useful**

I used this to analyze a complex 19-page contract in minutes instead of hours. It extracted critical obligations I might have missed, organized action items by priority, and highlighted security considerations. The depth control options let me tailor analysis depth based on urgency.

## **Business Objective**

Reduce document processing time by 70-80%, improve decision-making quality, and ensure critical information isn't overlooked in lengthy documents. Standardize knowledge extraction across the organization while maintaining security compliance.
