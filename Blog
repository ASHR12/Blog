## **How I Found It Useful**

This prompt makes it easy to turn complex technical content like API docs, system designs, or integration diagrams into simple business language. These documents often come from ISVs, SIs, or DocuSign’s own solution engineers when working on customer projects or partner integrations.

Instead of needing long meetings to explain technical details, this prompt creates clear summaries that sales, product, and business teams can quickly understand. It helps everyone see the purpose, value, and impact of a technical solution without needing to be deeply technical. This reduces confusion, speeds up collaboration, and helps move deals forward faster.

## **Business Objective**

It will help DocuSign teams clearly explain technical partner solutions like integrations, platform extensions, or system architectures from ISVs and SIs in simple, business-friendly language. This prompt enables faster internal alignment across sales, partner, and product teams by breaking down technical content into clear summaries that highlight business value, impact, and next steps.

By making it easier for non-technical stakeholders to understand what a partner is proposing, the system supports faster deal reviews, smoother partner onboarding, and more confident decision-making especially in complex solution sales where technology is a key part of the deal.
