Hi Everyone,

Tomorrow is my last working day in HSBC and looking back I can't believe itâ€™s been almost 5 years since I joined. This is my longest client project ever in 13 years of my career.

I have worked with some amazing people over the last few years. I may miss a few, but can't thank enough:

Abhishek Chaturvedi â€“ I have never had such an amazing person from the client side. He is just an amazing human.
Bala â€“ Always supportive, led the team in the best way.
Roger â€“ So good, you could always reach out to him in any scenario and he would help.

Hirok, Geeta, Yukta, Pradeep, Amar â€“ We worked very closely and always helped each other when needed, no matter what we were doing. Really great team.

(Also shoutout to Chesta and Susmita â€“ they left, but were great teammates too.)

Sze Tho and Harnim from business â€“ I worked closely with you both, and you were the best.

Thanks Prasad and Jyoti for all the help and support over the last one year.

To be honest, Iâ€™ve never felt this bad leaving any client project like Iâ€™m actually feeling while leaving HSBC.

I wish this team all the best in everything you do.
